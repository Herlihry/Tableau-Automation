# Tableau-Automation
This repo aims to automate tableau visuals by creating visuals based on file naming convention

DataframeToTableau: This script will read the data from a file into a Pandas DataFrame, create a new Tableau data source and upload the data from the DataFrame to it, create a new Tableau workbook and add the data source to it, create a new Tableau sheet and add it to the workbook, and then publish the workbook to Tableau Online or Tableau Server. You can modify the script to customize the workbook and sheet as needed.
